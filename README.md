-  Hi, I’m @justinmarkey, and Python is my go-to.
  
-  Passionate about Data Analytics and Finance. I am currently working on building out a financial statement analyzer with the goal of creating a functional securities data scraper and looking for atypical behavior on the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.
  
-  I am always looking to deploy my capital markets knowledge and create better insights for myself and others.
